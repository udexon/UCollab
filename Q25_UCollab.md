### UCollab (Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform): Free Software Revolution 2.0 -- Cloning Commercial Software Services, from Search Engines to Social Networks

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook is NOT run by Zuckerberg & company, BUT the Free Software Foundation.

- Imagine an alternate universe where your comment on Facebook is processed and stored NOT on Amazon's cloud server located at secret unknown locations, BUT encrypted and processed, but never stored, by a chain of mobile phones in your own neighbourhood. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook code is NOT written by programmers in a super campus in Silicon Valley, BUT by random programmers in the street or mountains far away from metropolitans. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where YOU do NOT just write comment on Facebook BUT are able to contribute one line of code at a time to improve or add new services to Facebook.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like YOU can EACH contribute code to Facebook one line at a time.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like YOU can EACH contribute code to NOT JUST Facebook,  but other world class social network applications that YOU can help to create.

Welcome to the future of "Cloudless Computing", with UCollab -- Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform.

This article is perhaps unusual in opening with a list of "imagine" scenarios. Nevertheless, we believe this is the easiest expression to make readers understand how the breakthrough we introduce in this article may change the world, quite literally.

Before we carry on to elaborate on our breakthrough, it is perhaps prudent to dispell the disbelieves that most readers may have concerning our ambitions -- by relating them to the original history of the free software movement.

To summarise:

- The free software movement initiated by the Free Software Foundation, which resulted in the GNU/Linux operating system and tools, was primarily aiming at ___cloning the proprietary Unix operating systems and tools___ during the 1980s. The eventual successes of the free software movement were so spectacular in powering the Internet and wireless communications ecosystems that the current generation of programmers have largely forgotten that cloning another commercial operating system and tools was very much ___a brute force exercise without too many original and novel ideas___.

Having understood that ___cloning without too many innovations___ has produced perhaps one of the greatest technological achievements in human history, involving the largest number of programmers, nation states and fields of human endeavour and the fastest acculumation of wealth, we would now like to convince readers that such a feat ___can be replicated___, using our breakthrough ___Phos Smashlet stack machine shell___.  

#### Benefits

- Even distribution of project profits and net worth amongst programmers: Facebook 40k employees USD 500B.
Bitcoin 600 contributors USD 100B.

- Education in Programming and Mathematics
Computer algebra system contribution to game Programming, robotics, artificial intelligence.

- Convergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

Simplify programming, more productive, cost saving, reduce learning curve

Make better app with division of labor, specialization. 

More people, develop faster. 

Flatter hierarchy. 

Spread profits. 

Cite history of GNU Tools. Fixed goal posts. Clone existing system. Zero cost. Always improve. Sure win. Question is how fast. Use this as main argument to tie present to future goals. Arrange goals chronologically. 

The biggest differences we have in 2020 compared to 1980 are:
- more experience- better technologies for team work and software engineering- proven net worth of companies- proven net worth of cryptocurrencies
- better hardware and software- more people, more devices, more storage, faster networks

Time to take to replicate 100% of MAGAF and Bitcoin?

And grow?

National currency ratio to cryptocurrency change over time?
