### UCollab (Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform): Free Software Revolution 2.0 -- Cloning Proprietary Software Services, from Search Engines to Social Networks

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook is NOT run by Zuckerberg & company, BUT the Free Software Foundation or equivalent.

- Imagine an alternate universe where your comment on Facebook is processed and stored NOT on Amazon's cloud server located at secret unknown locations, BUT encrypted and processed, but never stored, by a chain of mobile phones in your own neighbourhood. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook code is NOT written by programmers in a super campus in Silicon Valley, BUT by random programmers in the street or mountains far away from metropolitans. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where YOU do NOT just write comment on Facebook BUT are able to contribute one line of code at a time to improve or add new services to Facebook.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like YOU can EACH contribute code to Facebook one line at a time.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like YOU can EACH contribute code to NOT JUST Facebook,  but other world class social network applications that YOU can help to create.

Welcome to the future of "Cloudless Computing", with UCollab -- Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform.

This article is perhaps unusual in opening with a list of "imagine" scenarios. Nevertheless, we believe this is the easiest expression to make readers understand how the breakthrough we introduce in this article may change the world, quite literally.

Before we carry on to elaborate on our breakthrough, it is perhaps prudent to dispell the disbelieves that most readers may have concerning our ambitions -- by relating them to the original history of the free software movement.

To summarise:

- The free software movement initiated by the Free Software Foundation, which resulted in the GNU/Linux operating system and tools, was primarily aiming at ___cloning the proprietary Unix operating systems and tools___ during the 1980s. The eventual successes of the free software movement were so spectacular in powering the Internet and wireless communications ecosystems that the current generation of programmers have largely forgotten that cloning another commercial operating system and tools was very much ___a brute force exercise without too many original and novel ideas___.

Having understood that ___cloning without too many innovations___ has produced perhaps one of the greatest technological achievements in human history, involving the largest number of programmers, nation states and fields of human endeavour and the fastest acculumation of wealth, we would now like to convince readers that such a feat ___can be replicated___, using our breakthrough ___Phos Smashlet stack machine shell___.  


#### Measuring Successes in Replication

Historically, the following were examples used to measure the successes of free software replicating proprietary software:

- Web servers: Apache vs. Microsoft IIS
- Office Software: OpenOffice vs. Microsoft Office

We may now use the following to measure the successes in replicating conventional software services and businesses:

1. Time taken to replicate conventional businesses in shared economy businesses? Uber, AirBnB etc? And grow?
2. National currency ratio to cryptocurrency change over time?  and Bitcoin?
3. Time to take to replicate 100% of MAGAF -- Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook

Although the list above may look a little complicated, covering several fields which may not seem to be related, we shall attempt to explore their relationships, as in the end, they all manifest their results in dollars and cents and time, as with all human activities.

Item (1) or shared economy social media apps have now plenty of examples which provide us a wide range of data to study. They can be viewed as extensions of free software, as many of the business principles and operations are derived or based on free software. In our opinion, the most interesting aspect of shared economy seems to be the businesses that have not be "ported" to social meida. Of these, the most useful example would be cooking classes.

The shared economy cooking class business model can be summarized as follow:
- One investor (patron) invests USD 5. 
- 20 investors invest USD 100 in total.
- A Master chef brings 5 apprentice cooks to shop for raw ingredients for the day.
- The Master chef coaches the apprentice cooks to preprare the meals for the patrons.
- Extra portions of meal can be sold and the profits shared amongst participants.

Unfortunately, the propositions of shared economy of cooking classes and the historical role of overseas Chinese restaurants eliminating poverty do not fit the Western liberal narratives, in that:

- These propositions fundamentally assume Marx class struggles still exist, which the left and right of the West both deny.
- The history of overseas Chinese restaurants and recent economic miracles of China provide novel Chinese, non-violent solutions to Marxist class struggles.

Item (2) cryptocurrencies can also be viewed as an extension of free software. Althought the combine market capitalizations of various cryptocurrencies are now estimated at around USD 200 billion, with Bitcoin taking up the biggest portion, we believe the lack of understanding of the principles of public key encryption by ordinary users has become the biggest bottleneck in the growth of cryptocurrencies, where total world population who have used cryptocurrencies have not exceeded 1%. Our solution for this particular problem is illustrated in the [ Datong Token project ](https://github.com/udexon/DatongToken).

We believe (1) and (2) may have macroeconomic implications, in that they may significantly reduced poverty globally, especially based on the potential impact of the shared economy of cooking classes, where the history of Chinese restaurants has provided us plenty of examples how they helped the poorest in the overseas Chinese communities out of poverty, making it practically impossible to find hard core poor Chinese overseas nowadays.

We may dedicate separate articles to discuss items (1) and (2) above. However, our focus in this article is how Phos Smashlet can be used to replicate proprietary software services, thus bringing about Free Software Revolution 2.0:

- Time to take to replicate 100% of MAGAF -- Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook

#### Benefits

- Even distribution of project profits and net worth amongst programmers: Facebook 40k employees USD 500B.
Bitcoin 600 contributors USD 100B.

- Education in Programming and Mathematics
Computer algebra system contribution to game Programming, robotics, artificial intelligence.

- Convergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

Simplify programming, more productive, cost saving, reduce learning curve

Make better app with division of labor, specialization. 

More people, develop faster. 

Flatter hierarchy. 

Spread profits. 

Cite history of GNU Tools. Fixed goal posts. Clone existing system. Zero cost. Always improve. Sure win. Question is how fast. Use this as main argument to tie present to future goals. Arrange goals chronologically. 

The biggest differences we have in 2020 compared to 1980 are:
- more experience- better technologies for team work and software engineering- proven net worth of companies- proven net worth of cryptocurrencies
- better hardware and software- more people, more devices, more storage, faster networks

- 1980s GNU/Linux: mostly in C/C++, less fragmentations due to programming langauges and frameworks like 2020 -- solution by Phos Smashlet.

- Use bullet indent to signify new section - easiest, change later.

- Shared economy app, Uber, AirBnB, Food Panda etc, are best example of free software spin off replacing conventional businesses. These have been achieved with existing software engineering innovations.

- Cryptocurrencies is another example. But 99% adoption requires Signal, awareness of public key encryption - insufficient education. Datong Token.
