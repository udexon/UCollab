### UCollab: Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform.

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook is NOT run by Zuckerberg & company, BUT the Free Software Foundation.

- Imagine an alternate universe where your comment on Facebook is processed and stored NOT on Amazon's cloud server located at secret unknown locations, BUT encrypted and processed, but never stored, by a chain of mobile phones in your own neighbourhood. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where Facebook code is NOT written by programmers in a super campus in Silicon Valley, BUT by random programmers in the street or mountains far away from metropolitans. 

- Imagine an alternate universe where YOU do NOT just write comment on Facebook BUT are able to contribute one line of code at a time to improve or add new services to Facebook.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like you can EACH contribute code to Facebook one line at a time.

- Imagine an alternate universe where MILLIONS of programmers like YOU can EACH contribute code to NOT JUST Facebook,  but other world class social network applications that YOU can help to create.

Welcome to the future of "Cloudless Computing", with UCollab -- Universal Cloudless Collaborative Platform.

#### Benefits

- Even distribution of project profits and net worth amongst programmers: Facebook 40k employees USD 500B.
Bitcoin 600 contributors USD 100B.

- Education in Programming and Mathematics
Computer algebra system contribution to game Programming, robotics, artificial intelligence.

- Convergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

Simplify programming, more productive, cost saving, reduce learning curve

Make better app with division of labor, specialization. 

More people, develop faster. 

Flatter hierarchy. 

Spread profits. 

Cite history of GNU Tools. Fixed goal posts. Clone existing system. Zero cost. Always improve. Sure win. Question is how fast. Use this as main argument to tie present to future goals. Arrange goals chronologically. 

The biggest differences we have in 2020 compared to 1980 are:
- more experience- better technologies for team work and software engineering- proven net worth of companies- proven net worth of cryptocurrencies
- better hardware and software- more people, more devices, more storage, faster networks

Time to take to replicate 100% of MAGAF and Bitcoin?

And grow?

National currency ratio to cryptocurrency change over time?
