### Ucollab: Universal Collaborative Programming Platform



- Is it possible to create a platform where individual programmers can collaborate by contributing code one line at a time, instead of GitHub's one repository at a time? 

- Is it possible to create a platform where individual programmers can collaborate by contributing code one line at a time, run code in local browser JavaScript engine, instead of renting a multi GBs virtual machine?

- What can be achieved if millions of programmers contribute one line of code at a time continuously via the Ucollab Universal Collaborative Programming Platform?

Virtual machines in web browser, Android and iOS are spectacular technologies that were perhaps unimaginable even just a decade ago. Despite their wonderful features and superior hardware available today, they suffer from severe limitations, partly due to:

- Software designs, practices and architectures that are decades old and incompatible with each other;

- Commercial interests such as cloud computing that prevented or discouraged more open designs or architectures.

Despites these obstacles, we believe we have found the literal "Swiss army knife" of programming, called Phos Smashlet, or stack machine shell, derived from the legendary, half century old Forth programming language, that can overcome the limitations mentioned above. 

Based on Phos Smashlet, we propose to build Ucollab (Universal Collaborative Programming Platform), a platform that aims to achieve the goals listed above.
