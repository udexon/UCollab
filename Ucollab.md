### Ucollab: Universal Collaborative Programming Platform



- Is it possible to create a platform where individual programmers can collaborate by contributing code one line at a time, instead of GitHub's one repository at a time? 

- Is it possible to create a platform where individual programmers can collaborate by contributing code one line at a time, run code in local browser JavaScript engine, instead of renting a multi GBs virtual machine?

- What can be achieved if millions of programmers contribute one line of code at a time continuously via the Ucollab Universal Collaborative Programming Platform?

Virtual machines in web browser, Android and iOS are spectacular technologies that were perhaps unimaginable even just a decade ago. Despite their wonderful features and superior hardware available today, they suffer from severe limitations, partly due to:

- Software designs, practices and architectures that are decades old and incompatible with each other;

- Commercial interests such as cloud computing that prevented or discouraged more open designs or architectures.

Despites these obstacles, we believe we have found the literal "Swiss army knife" of programming, called Phos Smashlet, or stack machine shell, derived from the legendary, half century old Forth programming language, that can overcome the limitations mentioned above. 

Based on Phos Smashlet, we propose to build Ucollab (Universal Collaborative Programming Platform), a platform that aims to achieve the goals listed above.

### Convergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

As readers can see in the examples above, we have implemented a Convergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface (CHUDI), where a different programming language, Phos, is used to call upstream functions in the host programming language (Java, JavaScript, PHP), a first in the history of programming, i.e. a common downstream programming language (Phos) with different upstream programming languages. 

Conventionally, downstream programming languages, e.g. Python and Java, call upstream C/C++ functions, resulting in Divergent Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface (DHUDI), i.e. a common upstream programming language and different downstream programming languages. 

The terms "upstream" and "downstream" are borrowed from supply chain models. They also highlights the separation of roles of programmers enabled by CHUDI, just like the supply chain ecosystems. i.e. Downstream programmers need only need to use Phos, leaving the in depth work to develop Phos API in host programming languages to upstream developers.

The cost and time savings achievable with CHUDI will be tremendous, as retraining of programmers to cope with new programming languages can be reduced. This is a novel breakthrough in the history of software development.
