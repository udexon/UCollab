https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem

- Ad hominem (Latin for "to the person"),[1] short for argumentum ad hominem, typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

Ancient people did not have professional specializations like we have today. We would vet through a person's qualifications when we discuss certain expert topics. Unfortunately, the questions concerning Artificial General Intelligence and Technological Singularity involve such a fast scope that it is very likely that some of the so called "experts" are not really qualified, and yet, such discrepancies have not actually been publicized, perhaps due to the increasing acceptance of sensationalism and fake news within social media.

Lack of understanding of public key encryption (PKE). Need Phos to make Signal easier to learn. Phos lets programmers execute shell commands in parallel to host program, help test, understand, learn, develop. Replace documentation, which no one has time to make. Give examples in Reactive Sensors. 

Does RPN make better software engineering and documentation? Why?

By Graph Theory, two nodes can be collapse to one node. So RPN allow arbitrary level of abstraction, not so convenient in high level programming languages. Variables can be converted to stack manipulation in most cases = concatenate stack operation words, or isolate them as external parameters. Both lead to better software engineering and documentation.

RPN provides more flexibility and functionalities to manage code at lower level, hence leading to better software engineering. 

Using RPN, collapsing two nodes to one is not the only operation, but also label it, as well as being able to access the individual operators. i.e.

```
: c a b ;
: e c d ;
```

This makes it possible to test any combination of operations, by applying test functions to the colon definition word. 

Debug and test are also programs. They are important but programmers are not used to them, because lack of convenient and systematic notations like RPN. 

Must have large enough database of words, then only can do selection. From human programmers to automatic selection. Transform all GitHub code to colon definitions? 

Must write tutorial for Phos Homogotchi, Signal attract programmers, build up database for function selection for AGI.

Two stage benefits:
- First stage: UCollab simplified collaboration for any apps, especially Homogotchi and Signal.
- Second stage: when there are enough functions, achieve AGI.

Write above as RTTS, add timeline.
